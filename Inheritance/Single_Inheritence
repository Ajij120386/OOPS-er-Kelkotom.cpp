      Inheritance in C++ an Overview

Reusability is a very important feature of OOPs
In C++ we can reuse a class and add additional features to it
Reusing classes saves time and money
Reusing already tested and debugged classes will save a lot of effort of developing and debugging the same thing again

What is Inheritance in C++?

The concept of reusability in C++ is supported using inheritance
We can reuse the properties of an existing class by inheriting it
The existing class is called a base class
The new class which is inherited from the base class is called a derived class
Reusing classes saves time and money
There are different types of inheritance in C++

Forms of Inheritance in C++

Single Inheritance
Multiple Inheritance
Hierarchical Inheritance
Multilevel Inheritance
Hybrid Inheritance

{ // Class is being derived publically
    int data3;

public:
    void process();
    void display();
};

void Derived ::process()
{
    //as data1 privately declared so we cannot inherited directly
    data3 = data2 * getData1();
}

void Derived ::display()
{
    cout << "Value of data 1 is " << getData1() << endl;
    cout << "Value of data 2 is " << data2 << endl;
    cout << "Value of data 3 is " << data3 << endl;

    der.setData();
    der.process();
    der.display();
